    <h2>Chicago</h2>
    <p>We are a family owned Mediterranean restaurant located in Chicago, Illinois. 
        Our restaurant is focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. 
        Visit our restaurant near you for classic Italian dishes and flavours that only come from a brick oven fire â€“ 
        just the way it was when we first opened back in 1995!</p>
